Music Bot.
This is a music bot for others.

Go to the file named config, then go to bot.js, then you'll find a code like this.

    discord: {
        token: 'TOKEN',
        prefix: 'PREFIX',
        activity: 'ACTIVITY',
    },

In token you put the token of your bot.
In prefix you put the prefix you will use to use the commands of the bot.
And in acticity is the activity you want the bot to have, like: <prefix>Help. In discord will look like this.
  
  Playing: !help.
  
  



You need to install the following dependecies.

npm install discord.js
npm install discord-player
npm install ffmpeg-static
npm install nodemon
npm install @discordjs/opus

It doesn't matter the order of the instalation.
